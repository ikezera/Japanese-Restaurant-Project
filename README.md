# Japanese-Restaurant-Project
This is a Japanese restaurant website that I am designing to improve my web development skills.

This test website serves as a portfolio piece and a proposal to showcase to the restaurant I want to offer this website to.

I aim to create a visually appealing and functional design that enhances the restaurantâ€™s online presence. The website will include essential features such as a menu display, reservation system, and contact information to provide a seamless experience for customers.

Disclaimer: This is a test website generated with AI assistance as part of my learning process in web design.
